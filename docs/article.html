                        The Voyager missions, launched by NASA in the late
                        1970s, were designed to take advantage of a rare
                        alignment of the outer planets. These missions marked a
                        significant milestone in our quest to explore the solar
                        system. <strong>Voyager 1</strong> and
                        <strong>Voyager 2</strong> have since journeyed far
                        beyond their original destinations, entering
                        interstellar space and continuing to relay invaluable
                        data back to Earth.

                        >
                        and <em>Voyager 2</em>, were designed to take advantage
                        of a rare planetary alignment to explore the outer
                        planets. Voyager 1, launched on September 5, 1977,
                        focused on Jupiter and Saturn, providing unprecedented
                        <em>groundbreaking</em> insights into these gas giants
                        and their moons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of 2023, Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made
                        object in space, traveling beyond the heliosphere, the
                        outer limit of the Sun's magnetic influence. Voyager 2,
                        launched on August 20, 1977, took a longer trajectory
                        and became the only spacecraft to visit Uranus and
                        Neptune. Both missions have
                        <em>exceeded their original goals</em> and continue to
                        relay valuable scientific data. Interestingly, each
                        Voyager carries a <strong>Golden Record</strong>, a
                        12-inch gold-plated copper disk containing sounds and
                        images selected to portray the diversity of life and
                        culture on Earth, serving as a message to possible
                        extraterrestrial life. As of now, the Voyager spacecraft
                        are expected to run out of power and cease operations by
                        2025, but their journey into the unknown continues to
                        inspire and intrigue.

                        This program demonstrates basic Voyager spacecraft
                        communication monitoring. The
                        <code>DISTANCE</code> variable stores the spacecraft's
                        range in kilometers, which at 24 billion km represents
                        Voyager 1's approximate distance from Earth. The
                        subroutine <code>COMPUTE_SIGNAL</code> calculates signal
                        strength degradation over this vast distance. The
                        conditional block beginning with
                        <code>IF (SIGNAL .LT. 0.001)</code> checks whether the
                        received signal falls below a critical threshold,
                        setting <code>STATUS = 1</code> to flag potential
                        communication issues. This type of code was essential
                        for the Deep Space Network operators monitoring the
                        Voyager probes as they ventured into interstellar space.

                <p>Carl Sagan once said:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilizations in interstellar space. But the launching of this 'bottle' into the cosmic 'ocean' says something very hopeful about life on this planet."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3>Future of Space Exploration</h3>
                <p>The impact of the Voyager missions is immeasurable. They have inspired generations and paved the way for future explorations into the unknown.</p>
